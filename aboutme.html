		<div id="aboutme">I am a programmer who has been writing code for over 10 years now. I have been developing games and applications using C++, J2ME, Apple iPhone, Android etc. And more server stuff using Spring framework. 
			<p>
				I have great passion for Tamil Literature and the age old temples of India built by the finest Kings and Emperors to rule the country. I have been blogging about Tamil literature and Temples since 2005. And here is <a href="http://rprabhu.blogspot.com" target="_blank">my blog</a>, since then my passion has been ever-growing. This dictionary application is just my contribution to the Tamil community of the world
